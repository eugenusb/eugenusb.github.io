# Personal blog

Hi there! My name is Eugenio Borghini and this is my personal blog, generated using Jekyll's clean blog [theme](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/clean-blog-jekyll).
Here you will mainly find posts on mathematics, algorithms and Machine Learning. For the moment, my intention is to only share ideas that I consider original or 
difficult to find elsewhere.
