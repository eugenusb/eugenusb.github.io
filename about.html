	Hi! My name is Eugenio Borghini. It seems customary to define oneself by one's profession, so let's start there :) <br/>
	I earned a Ph.D. in Mathematics at the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina and currently hold a postdoc at 
	Swansea University focused on industrial applications of Machine Learning techniques.
</p>
<p>
	More broadly, I enjoy taking part at competitions that involve coding (algorithms, optimization, Machine Learning, etc.),
	listening to music, traveling, used to be an avid reader of fiction and love learning languages. <br/>
	One of the achievements I'm most proud of is having prepared two teams that made it to the <a href='https://icpc.global/'>ICPC World Finals</a>,
	both from the University of Buenos Aires: <br/>
	<ul>
		<li> Team <i>El Bueno, el Ralo y el Feo</i> composed by <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/aborgna/?originalSubdomain=ar'>Agustín Borgna</a>, <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/teodoro-freund/?originalSubdomain=ar'>Teodoro Freund</a>, and <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/andr%C3%A9s-radunsky-38689b1b9/?originalSubdomain=ar'>Andrés Radunsky</a> (check this brief <a href='https://vk.com/@icpcnews-el-bueno-el-ralo-y-el-feo-and-coach-eugenio-borghini-meetthe'>intro</a>). </li>
		<li> Team <i>Prim Floyd</i> composed by Marcos Blufstein, <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/julian-braier-5743b250/?originalSubdomain=ar'>Julián Braier</a>, and <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateo-marenco-38b40a135/?locale=es_ES'>Mateo Marenco</a>.
	</ul>
</p>
Ok, ok, actually they were brilliant to start with and most of the merit is theirs... but let me be proud anyway!
